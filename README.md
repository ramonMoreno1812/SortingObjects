# SortingObjects

Project makes use of Objects, Array List, Collections .sort, Comparable interface, @Overide methods, Exception handeling, loops, scanner,


The user is prompted to enter the number of people he/she wants on their list. The user than can enter a firstName, lastName,
and age for each 'Person' object in their list. The program takes the input from the user one by one and creates a Person 
object and stores it in an array list. This program checks for errors using exception handling making sure all inputs are of the same type. 
Since the objects are stored in an Array list, I am able to call the Collections class and access the.sort method to print my list in alphabetical order. 
This However cannot be done if my Person class does not implement the Comparable interface which allows me to sort my Person list when called. 
In my person class I have added a method override in order to sort my person by first name. The program prints my List first unsorted and then unsorted.
